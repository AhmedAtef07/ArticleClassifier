started
work
problem
appeared
simple
turned
quite
difficult
wondering
anyone
seen
problem
hopefully
published
solutions
problem
draw
outline
surface
defined
roughly
parallel
cubic
splines
inputs
problem
essentially
starts
sets
points
each
set
points
edge
object
treat
dimensional
extant
between
edges
exists
three
dimensional
space
draw
object
fit
cubic
spline
through
points
each
spline
effectively
computed
sequence
line
segments
approximating
curve
each
spline
equal
number
segments
assume
nth
segment
along
each
spline
roughly
exactly
same
distance
along
each
spline
reasonable
measure
take
each
segment
along
each
spline
match
nth
segment
opposing
spline
use
pair
segments
form
triangles
filled
color
surface
depth
sort
triangles
take
each
triangle
sorted
order
project
onto
pixmap
draw
color
triangle
take
edge
triangle
along
edge
surface
draw
line
along

heart
problem
idea
effectively
outline
edge
surface
result
generally
lots
breaks
gaps
edge
surface
reasons
fairly
complicated
involve
both
rasterization
problems
problems
resulting
projecting
splines
anything
problem
sounds
familiar
appreciate
knowing
work
area
thanks
