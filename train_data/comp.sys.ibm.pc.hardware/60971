obviously
please
take
note
following
exactly
happens
slightly
simplified
explanation
technically
irq

means

soundblaster
modem

signal
cpu
something
happening
here
please
take
note
cpu
programmed
handle
signal
usually
operating
system
dos
interrupt
vector
used
store
address
function
handles
each
interrupt
basic
dos
doesn
care
whether
printer
reports
ready
print
stuff
simply
ignores
interrupt
dos
prints
looks
lpt
buffer

irq
ignored
printer
interrupt
free
use

case
multitasking
otherwise
advanced
kind
printing
approach
doesn
work
precisely
wastes
lot
cpu
cycles
hence
share

another
issue
digitized

uses
interrupts
plays
plain
music
cpu
simply
tells

otherwise
digitized
