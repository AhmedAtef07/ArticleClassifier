risc
usually
small

risc
hmm
authority
risc
clearly
remember
reading
instruction

risc
cpus
large
difference
addressing
modes
risc
instruction
sets
orthogonal
cisc
theoretically
supposed
reduced
longer
everyone
arguing
risc
cisc
personally
think
cisc
win
take
look
pentium
intel
architectures
another
story
bye
mean
pentium
better
risc
outsell
first
remember
intel
cisc
pentium
always
generation
away
best
riscs
riscs
cpu
costly
sold
same
quantities
same
order
remember
reading
years
maybe
t800
hypercube
mips
superscallar
reordered
instruction
itself
sure
think
t800
25mhz
transputer
tie
gazillion
together
100mips
newest
t9000
kicks
anyone
butt
haven
seen
used
though
anyway
respond
think
pentium
cisc
better
advanced
risc
alpha
etc
66mhz
pentium
approximately
same
performance
superduper
133mhz
alpha
here
performance
weird
specint92
everyone
refers
heard
alpha
still
kicks
butt
again
heard
computing
world
sell
lots
chips
intel
make
faster
intel
winner
intel
though
sucky
architecture
over
years
ago
intel
make
cisc
chip
superscalar
superduperpipelined
superfast
ideas
behind
risc
ideology
cisc
chip
admit
see
advantages
risc
over
cisc
latest
technology
generation
behind
sucks
relatively
speaking
sound
intel
real
kick
butt
pile
sio2
hope
motorola
really
