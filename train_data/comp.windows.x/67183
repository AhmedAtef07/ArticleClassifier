display
pretty
darn
fast
using
server
pixmaps
shared
memory
insert
delay
loop
keep
going
quickly
testing
both
methods
side

equal
advantage
shm

doesn
grow
ridiculous
sizes
pixmaps
work
over

problem
operating
systems
ultrix
seem
allow
small
number
segments

xshmattach
xshmputimage
xshmdetach
dec
systems
dec
bit
displays

tend
use
seem
support
extension
maybe
someone
compiled
wrong
using
pixmaps
causes
server
crash
failed
mallocs
use
local
unix
domain
socket
really
isn
bad
copies
info
three
times
per
redraw
instead
short
allowing
three
forms
display
within
program
good
thing
minus
shm
running
over
